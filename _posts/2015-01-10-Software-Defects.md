### How to Actually Reduce Software Defects

“Prevention is Better than Cure” is best universal thought ,if the software has defects. We can do prevention through Software development life cycle. If there is any fault in software development process, it will cause to generate defects in  the final output. Lot of defects will create during the development process. Defect prevention is important point and it will provide lot of benefits such as reducing reworking effort, reducing maintenance cost and enhancing the productivity.

There are several methods to reduce software defects. I am going to discuss few of them here. Generally, reviews and inspections is a good way to reduce defects, that can be done during  the development. This can be done as a self-review or peer review. 

If we can do prototyping of the actual design, it gives the basic idea of the product functionality. This method also reduces defects that can be happened during the development.

Identifying the  root cause of defect is  the most important factor to prevent defect from recurring. To identify  the root cause, there is root cause analysis and it divided into two analysis methods.

01. Pareto analysis

02. Fishbone analysis

#### Pareto Analysis

Pareto Analysis is a statistical technique in decision-making used for the selection of a limited number of tasks that produce significant overall effect(“Pareto Analysis Step by Step,” n.d.).


#### Fishbone analysis

A fishbone diagram, also called a cause and effect diagram or Ishikawa diagram, is a visualization tool for categorizing the potential causes of a problem in order to identify its root causes. This  looks like a backbone of the fish. There is straight line which leads to the head which list the problem or issue to be studied.
